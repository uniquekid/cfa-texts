global.GameUpdateText = 'NEW FEATURES:
- Divine Skill icon support.
- "Megacolony Battler+ "Type.C"" has been increased to 16 copies.
- Over Triggers and Regalis Pieces have been set to 1 copy maximum.
- Added support for Infinity Eyes markers.
- There are 2 versions of the Infinity Eyes marker; Primary and Alter. The Alter version is to be used in the case of a Levidras mirror match. Removal of the Primary marker is done by right clicking the right side of the circle. Removal of the Alter marker requires holding down the CTRL key and right clicking the right side of the circle.
- Added support for Undercover Gauges by allowing cards under the order to be flipped, or to directly be sent under the order face down by holding down the SHIFT key.
- Cards sent under an order card while the SHIFT key is held and ones sent to Bind Zone will travel across the field face down to keep their identity hidden.
- When viewing the game action log with the Q button, deck shuffling will only appear once when the shuffle button is clicked multiple times.
BUG FIXES:
- The "Reveal Top Deck" button will no longer accidentally reveal the bottom card of the deck.
- Addressed a bug that would not prompt the G Assist Button when nationless orders were in hand.'
