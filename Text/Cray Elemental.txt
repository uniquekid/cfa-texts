If you have a vanguard with persona ride, and you did not ride this turn, remove this card, and activate persona ride. Until end of turn, you cannot ride, and cannot activate persona ride.

CONT [Hand/Drop]: When you would pay the cost for Stride, if the cards being discarded for that cost do not specify a card name, and your vanguard has a clan icon, it can be paid with "Remove a "Primordial Heart Blaze" from hand or drop & turn up to one card from the damage zone face up.". (Counter Charge 1)'
